# Windows.ArcSys
Holds the ArcSys source code.  This is maintained in Visual Source Safe, but copied here.

This is written in Visual Studio 2010, which does not have the ability to integrate to GitHub.  So the source code is still maintained in Visual Studio, on a virtual machine.  When a new release is made the source code is copied here.
